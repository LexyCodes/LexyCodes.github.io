# [OhMyFood](https://lexycodes.github.io/index.html)
A 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. 
This is a classic reservation system, allowing orders to be made prior to arrival. 

This website is designed with a mobile view at the forefront of the mind, but is responsive and friendly to use on laptops and tablets alike. 

This project utilises HTML & CSS only. 

The main learning objectives were to gain a working understanding of:
1. Coding with SCSS
2. Animating with CSS

Files are organised as follows:
1. The index.html file contains the home-page of the project, to which all other files and folders are connected.
2. The Pages folder contains the other html pages, which host each relevant restaurant (4 in total)
3. The Images folder contains all imagery required to run the website
4. The Stylesheet folder has two further folders containing the SCSS & the CSS codes separately.

To run the page, please click the link above. 

I hope you enjoy your experience!
